Utilities
=========


This is kind of a "junk drawer" repo; it's going to contain code that I find useful
and have written, but doesn't really belong elsewhere or deserve its own repo. Feel free to 
adapt these and use them for your own purposes. Part of growing as a programmer is analyzing
code, figuring out which bits are salient and applicable to your own projects, and I encourage you to do that. I will do my best to explain
what I use these for with an eye for providing enough context to allow you to adapt it for your own uses.
